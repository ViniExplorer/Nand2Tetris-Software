# Vini's Nand2Tetris Software Solutions
These are my solutions for projects 6-12 of the Nand2Tetris course, the software section.  

This spans a full Jack (a Java like language from this course) compiler, and the OS libraries 
for the Hack computer.

The projects are organised as such: 
- **6**: Assembler -> translate Hack Assembly code into binary instructions.
- **7-8**: VM Translator -> translate VM code into Assembly.
- **9-11**: Jack Compiler -> translate the Jack language into VM code.

These are mostly programmed in Java. ANTLR4 was used for the Assembler, and
plain Java code was chosen for the remaining code.
